To build the code:

  - You need Visual Studio 2008 or the .NET 3.5 SDK to build from the command prompt.

  - To build from the command prompt, use MSBuild.exe. The default target is Build. Look
    in BehaveN.msbuild to see what the other targets do.

To build the documentation:

  - Download and install the HTML Help Workshop:
    - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985(VS.85).aspx

  - Download and install Sandcastle:
    - http://sandcastle.codeplex.com/

  - Download and install the Sandcastle Help File Builder:
    - http://shfb.codeplex.com/
    - You don't really need this to just build, but it's nice to have to edit the .shfb file.

  - Download and install the Sandcastle Styles:
    - http://sandcastlestyles.codeplex.com/

  - Use MSBuild.exe /t:Documentation to make the CHM file.

To make a release:

  - Make sure your local repository is clean.

  - Update the version number in VERSION.txt. Use the current
    repository version + 1 as the last number. This will be the
    version checked in to HG.

  - Update HISTORY.txt to include the version and date.

  - Run MSBuild.exe /t:Release to make the ZIP file.

  - Upload the ZIP file to Google Code.

  - Check the changed files in to HG.
