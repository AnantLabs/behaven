To build the code:

  - You need Visual Studio 2008 or the .NET 3.5 SDK to build from the command prompt.

  - To build from the command prompt, use MSBuild.exe. The default target is Build. Look
    in BehaveN.msbuild to see what the other targets do.

To build the documentation:

  - Download and install the HTML Help Workshop:
    - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985(VS.85).aspx

  - Download and install Sandcastle:
    - http://sandcastle.codeplex.com/

  - Download and install the Sandcastle Help File Builder:

  - Download and install the Sandcastle Styles:
    - http://sandcastlestyles.codeplex.com/

  - Use MSBuild.exe /t:Documentation to make the CHM file.
